## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Package Bundler

### Useful resources

- [date-fns package](https://date-fns.org/docs/Getting-Started) - This helped me to simplify the project code to calculate the age. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
